### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Joshua Roland but you can call me **Volts, 289volts :zap:**

Here are some few things about me:

- I have a strong interest in web accessibility because i believe that the web should be used by 'all' irrespective of the circumstances.
- ðŸ”­ I work with NextJS, Sanity, TailwindCss, Framer-motion, GSAP, Docker, Firebase, MongoDB, NodeJS, REST APIs.

My expertise includes;
- development of accessible and SEO optimized websites.
- accessibility audit of website and apps.
- development of performant web apps focused on revenue generation.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently open to work on frontend related projects.

Some of my projects include: <br>
[RemoteWorkPadi](www.remoteworkpadi.com) - A job board built to help connect Africans to more remote opportunities. It removes the stress of sourcing for jobs by providing verified job links and resources that'll make the application process fast and seemless.<br> <br> The platform currently runs a subscription model, with up to 12k registered users and was mostly built and maintained by me.

[The Guest Gallery](www.theguestgallery.com) - Ever hosted an event and the photographer told you that they lost some pictures after the event or the pictures and videos they sent to you wasn't giving what it should give? The Guest Gallery is your backup plan to preserving the memory of your event through the help of your guest. <br><br>
By giving your guests the opportunity to upload the photos and videos they take at your event, you have more photographers and videographers than you paid for. <br><br>
The platform currently runs a SaaS model, with up to 500 users and was built and maintained by me.
